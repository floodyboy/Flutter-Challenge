Flutter 30 Day Challenge

This is Flutter 30 Day Challenge. I will upload atleast one app daily made in FLutter and make a folder for each day.
More than one app a day is always welcome.

Learning and Experimenting is an essential part of development, so I will be tracking my development curve of Flutter during this 30 Day Challenge. It will make learning Fun.
